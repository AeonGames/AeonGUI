{"name":"AeonGUI","tagline":"Portable video game graphic user interface library.","body":"### The Software Library\r\nThe AeonGUI library is intended as a portable graphic user interface library\r\nto be used primarily on video games and interactive media.\r\nIts goals are to keep the rendering engine separated from widget logic to make things easier for\r\nwould be users (developers intending to use the library on their own product), \r\nrenderer writers (developers looking to implement support for a particular graphic API) and\r\nwidget writers (developers looking to add new controls to the library).\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nThe library is currently under development and its API is changing a lot, it is not functionally complete yet, but there is already plenty of work done.\r\n\r\n### History\r\nThe idea for the library was born around 2004 or 2005 under the name 'Glitch', and has evolved overtime but never quite reached maturity.\r\nThe name change to AeonGUI came about as a way to identify the library as part of the AeonGames brand\r\nand to avoid confusion since originally the name 'GLitch' was chosen to emphasize OpenGL support, which is still the priority, but not necessarily the only graphic API supported.\r\n\r\n### Compilation\r\nThe library uses CMake to build the required files used to build the binary depending on the platform.\r\nFor information on how to use CMake refer to [www.cmake.org](www.cmake.org).\r\nThere is only \"official\" support for Windows and Linux at this time, \r\nhowever, Linux builds may break and lag from time to time as most development is done on Windows.\r\n\r\nOptional USE variables are available to add support for various features such as freetype font rendering and PNG file format loading, these add external dependencies to the library, so they are all initially set to OFF, if turned ON, the user has the option to provide the dependencies or let CMake download and configure the dependencies which will show up as projects inside the build environment.\r\nThe rules to download and configure external dependencies are most useful to Windows users as Linux distributions usually provide development libraries for most software packages.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe library is released under the terms of the permissive [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), however the Aeon Games logo is NOT covered by the Apache license,\r\nit is a Trade Mark and may not be used for any purpose outside the demo code without permission.\r\n\r\n### AUTHOR\r\nThe only author (for now) of AeonGUI is Rodrigo Hernandez and can be reached at kwizatz at aeongames dot com. \r\nPlease feel free and encouraged to clone and tinker with the code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
